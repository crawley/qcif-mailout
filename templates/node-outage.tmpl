We have encountered a hardware issue while upgrading one of the QRIScloud
compute nodes.  A service request has been lodged with the hardware vendor.
The affected compute node will remain offline until the fault can be rectified.

This concerns the following instances in your NeCTAR tenant:

  Tenant name: {{ db['tenants'][group['id']].name }}
  Tenant ID:   {{ group['id'] }}

Instances:
{% for instance in group['instances'] %}
    Instance name: {{ instance.name }}
    Instance ID:   {{ instance.name }}
    IP address:    {{ instance.accessIPv4 }}
    Compute node:  {{ instance.to_dict()['OS-EXT-SRV-ATTR:host'] }}
{% endfor %}

We apologise for any inconvenience.  We will let you know as soon as the
compute node is operational again.

Please email <support@qriscloud.org.au> if you have any questions.
