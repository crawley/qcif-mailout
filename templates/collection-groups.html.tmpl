<p>Over the next few weeks, QCIF will be implementing some important changes
to the way that QRISdata Collections are exposed to users.  The key benefits
will be that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Collection users will access them using per-user accounts managed created
    via the QRIScloud User Portal.</li>
  <li>Collection managers will be able to grant and rescind individuals
    access.</li>
  <li>The old "shared" accounts for each collection will be retired.</li>
  <li>The old "collection VMs" will be replaced with shared access servers
    with better availability and performance.</li>
  <li>Collections will be accessible on Euramoo and Flashlite.</li>
</ul>

<p>As the first step in this process, we need all owners / managers of existing
accounts to register an account on the QRIScloud Portal.  For each collection
we also need someone to become the owner of the pair of access groups that
control collection access.</p>

<p>If you don't already have a QRIScloud User Portal account, please visit
<a href="https://services.qriscloud.org.au/">the User Portal</a> to register.

<ul>
  <li>You will first be redirected to the AAF Organization Selector to
    select your organization.</li>
  <li>Then you will be directed to your organization's AAF login page.</li>
  <li>Then you will be directed to the QRIScloud registration page.</li>
  <li>When you have completed the registration, you will be sent a
    "welcome" email by the QRIScloud Support ticketting system (Zendesk),
    with a request to confirm your Zendesk registration.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you have done that, please click the following links to become
an owner of the corresponding groups.</p>

Your collections groups are:

<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <th>Collection ID</th>
    <th>Title</th>
    <th>Read-write group</th>
    <th>Read-only group</th>
    <th>Your role</th>
  </tr>
  {% for resource in user.resources.values() %}
  <tr>
    <td>{{ resource['q_number'] }}</td>
    <td>{{ resource.title }}</td>
    <td><a href="https://services.qriscloud.org.au/access/{{ resource.RW_group_UUID }}/owner">Become group owner</a>
    </td>
    <td><a href="https://services.qriscloud.org.au/access/{{ resource.RO_group_UUID }}/owner">Become group owner</a>
    </td>
    <td>collection {{ 'custodian' if resource.Type == 'P' else 'requester' if resourceType == 'R' else 'technical contact' }}</td>
  </tr>
{% endfor %}
</table>
  
{% endblock %}
