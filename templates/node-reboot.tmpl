A QRIScloud compute node has encountered a problem that required an unscheduled
restart   As a consequence, all instances running on the node needed to be
rebooted.

This concerns the following instance in your NeCTAR Tenant:

  Tenant name: {{ db['tenants'][group['id']].name }}
  Tenant ID:   {{ group['id'] }}

Instances:
{% for instance in group['instances'] %}
    Instance name: {{ instance.name }}
    Instance ID:   {{ instance.name }}
    IP address:    {{ instance.accessIPv4 }}
    Compute node:  {{ instance.to_dict()['OS-EXT-SRV-ATTR:host'] }}
{% endfor %}

We apologise for any inconvenience.  

Please email <support@qriscloud.org.au> if experience any problems with
your instance.
