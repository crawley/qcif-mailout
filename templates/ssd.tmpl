This concerns the following instances in your NeCTAR tenant:

  Tenant name: {{ db['tenants'][group['id']].name }}
  Tenant ID:   {{ group['id'] }}

Instances:

{% for instance in group['instances'] %}
    Instance name: {{ instance.name }}
    Instance ID:   {{ instance.name }}
    IP address:    {{ instance.accessIPv4 }}
    Compute node:  {{ instance.hostname }}
{% endfor %}

On March 10th and 11th, QRIScloud operations will be adding Solid State Drives
(SSDs) to the compute hardware that run some of your QRIScloud NeCTAR instances.
This is part of an upgrade program is aimed at increasing the number of NeCTAR
instances that that QRIScloud can support, as described here:

  - https://qriscloud.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/207271726

Our original plan was to use OpenStack's "live migration" feature to move
instances between the compute nodes as they upgraded.  However, this approach
has proven to be problematic, and we are now planning to shut down (i.e. power
off) instances to allow the hardware upgrades.

This new strategy will result in rolling outages of roughly 30 minutes for the
instances as compute nodes are upgraded.  We cannot give a schedule for when
each instance will be shut down, but the procedure will be as follows:

  1.  All instances in "RUNNING" state on the compute node will be shut down.
  2.  The compute node will be taken out of service, the SSD will be installed
      and tested, and the compute node will be restored.
  3.  The instances that were shut down in step 1. will be rebooted.

The compute nodes that are due to be upgraded are cnxx through cnyy

While we do not anticipate that this procedure will cause any damage to
your instances, this is always a possibility.  We therefore advise the
following:

  1.  Inform any users of your instances that there will be an outage.
  2.  Ensure that you have a current backup any important data on your
      instances' disks.
  3.  If your instances need to be shutdown or restarted in a particular
      way, please take care of this yourself.  We will not restart any
      instances that were not RUNNING at the point we shut down a compute
      node.  Thus, if you shut down instances yourself, you can control
      when and how they are restarted.
  4.  If a 30 minute instance outage will be problematic, you could migrate
      the affected instances to a different availability zone.  If you plan
      to do this, please do it well in advance of the outage period.
      
If you have questions about this outage that are not address by this email,
please email <support@qriscloud.org.au>.
