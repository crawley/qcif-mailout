--------------------

Yesterday afternoon, we were able to repair 2 of the 3 QRIScloud compute nodes
with faulty chassis and return them to service.  (We are still waiting for
the vendor to complete hardware repairs for the 3rd compute node.)

All instances on compute nodes CN44 & CN52 that we shutdown on March 17 / 18th
to perform the SSD upgrade that triggered these problems have now been
restarted.  Other instances on these nodes that you shut down prior to the
outage may now be restarted via the NeCTAR Dashboard.

Please check that your instances are now working normally, and let us know if
there are any problems via an email to <support@qriscloud.org.au>.

---------------------------

This concerns the following NeCTAR Tenant and Instances:

  Tenant name: {{ db['tenants'][group['id']].name }}
  Tenant ID:   {{ group['id'] }}

Instances:
{% for instance in group['instances'] %}
    Instance name: {{ instance.name }}
    Instance ID:   {{ instance.name }}
    IP address:    {{ instance.accessIPv4 }}
    Compute node:  {{ instance.to_dict()['OS-EXT-SRV-ATTR:host'] }}
{% endfor %}
